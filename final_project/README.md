    # SPLIT OR TREAT
    #### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
    #### Description: Split or Treat asks user to enter a bill. Once the bill is entered,
        it asks the user if they would like to give a tip. If the user chooses to give a tip,
        the user is prompted to give the tip percentage which is 10%, 12%, or 15%. The tip amount
        is then calculated and added to the bill to get the total amount. If the user chooses
        not to give a tip, 0 is added to the tip amount.
        The program then asks the user to either split the bill or treat. If the user chooses to 
        "SPLIT", the user is asked to enter the number of people to split the bill 
        between. The program then divides the total bill by the number of people to get the 
        bill per person.
        If the user chooses to "TREAT", the user is asked to enter the names of people who might 
        be selected randomly to treat (Pay the total bill). The program then selects a random 
        person to pay the bill.
